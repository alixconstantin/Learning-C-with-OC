My learning of the C language with Openclassrooms courses

All files, programs, etc. will be written and edited with the VIM text editor in order to practice  
All files, programs, etc. will be written with the 42 Normes ( except for the header ) :

Some parts would'nt respect the Norme due to functions and structures that are used in learning C, but are not allowed by the norminette
